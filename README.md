# Concentration Game
Welcome! This is iOS based Halloween themed game of Concentration inspired by CS193P taught at Stanford University.

**What is this game?** <br/>
This is a simple game of concentration designed currently for the iPhone, mainly for teaching myself how to develop applications for iOS. Though please feel free to fork this project anytime and build on it. 

**What's interesting about this game?** <br/>
Throughout the source code I have made comments about important concepts that I thought would be useful for people referring to this. 

**Where can you learn more about this game?** <br/>
If you're new to iOS developement as well or you just want to build on your existing skills, head to the iOS development course taught by Paul Hegarty from Stanford University on [iTunesU](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1315130780?mt=2) where you can learn more about this game.

**Who's Involved?** <br/>
I am the sole contributor to this repository at the moment. While the skeletal code is courtesy of the online Stanford lectures on iTunesU, I am constantly making imporvements and adding new features to the game to test what I have learned from the course.  

**What can you expect in the future?** <br/>
I am also currently planning and conceptualizing tvOS and macOS versions of the game that I hope to release in the coming months.
